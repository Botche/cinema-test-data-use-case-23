Create a console app named "CinemaTestData" with .NET 6, Bogus and CSVHelper. The generated test data represents an arbitrary dataset of movies, series, and credits related to them. Store generated test data in separate files in CSV format.
Generate data with Bogus based on these criteria:
titles.id numeric title identifier 
titles.title textual movie (series) name 
titles.description textual title description 
titles.release_year should have a Common Era year format 
titles.age_certification should be one of these: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA 
titles.runtime should be a common title duration in minutes 
titles.genres should contain a list of strings representing various movie (series) genres 
titles.production_country should represent a country in ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code 
titles.seasons should represent the number of seasons for series or be empty for movies 
credits.id numeric credits identifier 
credits.title_id corresponding title id 
credits.real_name full credits member name 
credits.character_name corresponding movie (series) character name 
credits.role should represent corresponding role and be one of these: Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Film Editor, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Music Composer

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Globalization;
using System.IO;
using Bogus;
using CsvHelper;

namespace CinemaTestData
{
    public class Program
    {
        public class Title
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public string TitleName { get; set; }

            public string AgeCertification { get; set; }
            public int Runtime { get; set; }
            public List<string> Genres { get; set; }
            public string ProductionCountry { get; set; }
            public int? Seasons { get; set; }
        }

        public class Credit
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public int TitleId { get; set; }
            public string RealName { get; set; }
            public string CharacterName { get; set; }
            public string Role { get; set; }
        }

        public static void Main()
        {
            var titleFaker = new Faker<Title>()
                .RuleFor(o => o.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
                .RuleFor(o => o.TitleName, f => f.Lorem.Sentence())
                .RuleFor(o => o.Description, f => f.Lorem.Paragraph())
                .RuleFor(o => o.ReleaseYear, f => f.Date.Between(new DateTime(1900, 1, 1), DateTime.Now).Year)
                .RuleFor(o => o.AgeCertification, f => f.PickRandom(new[] { "G", "PG", ... /* other certifications */ }))
                .RuleFor(o => o.Runtime, f => f.Random.Int(30, 240))
                .RuleFor(o => o.Genres, f => f.Random.ListItems(new[] { "Action", "Drama", "Comedy" }, f.Random.Int(1, 3)))
                .RuleFor(o => o.ProductionCountry, f => f.Address.CountryCode())
                .RuleFor(o => o.Seasons, f => f.Random.Bool(0.8) ? null : (int?)f.Random.Int(1, 10));

            var creditFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
                .RuleFor(o => o.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
                .RuleFor(o => o.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(0, 999))  // Assuming up to 1000 titles.
                .RuleFor(o => o.RealName, f => f.Name.FullName())
                .RuleFor(o => o.CharacterName, f => f.Name.FirstName())
                .RuleFor(o => o.Role, f => f.PickRandom(new[] { "Director", "Producer", ... /* other roles */ }));

            var titles = titleFaker.Generate(1000);
            var credits = creditFaker.Generate(5000);  // Assuming 5 credits per title on average.

            using var writerTitles = new StreamWriter("titles.csv");
            using var csvTitles = new CsvWriter(writerTitles, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
            csvTitles.WriteRecords(titles);

            using var writerCredits = new StreamWriter("credits.csv");
            using var csvCredits = new CsvWriter(writerCredits, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
            csvCredits.WriteRecords(credits);
        }
    }
}
Adjust the number of titles and credits generated according to your needs.

Run the app with dotnet run, and it should create titles.csv and credits.csv with the desired data.

Create enum from this G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA 
ChatGPT
When defining an enum in C#, we typically use camel-case identifiers without special characters. Since some of your age certifications have characters like /, +, or -, we'll need to modify those to create valid enum identifiers.

Here's how you can define an enum with those age certifications:

csharp
Copy code
public enum AgeCertification
{
    G,
    PG,
    PG13,
    R,
    NC17,
    U,
    UA,
    A,
    S,
    AL,
    Six = 6,
    Nine = 9,
    Twelve = 12,
    TwelveA,
    Fifteen = 15,
    Eighteen = 18,
    EighteenR,
    R18,
    R21,
    M,
    MA15Plus,
    R16,
    R18Plus,
    X18,
    T,
    E,
    E10Plus,
    EC,
    C,
    CA,
    GP,
    MPG,
    TVY,
    TVY7,
    TVG,
    TVPG,
    TV14,
    TVMA
}
You'll notice that for numbers and special characters, I've spelled out the numbers and replaced special characters with words (like "Plus"). You can use these enum values in your program now.

Can you create collection from the previous list
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you want to create a collection (e.g., a List<string>) from the previous certifications, here's how you can do it:

csharp
Copy code
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<string> ageCertifications = new List<string>
        {
            "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", 
            "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", 
            "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", 
            "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA"
        };

        // You can now use the 'ageCertifications' list as desired
        foreach(var certification in ageCertifications)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(certification);
        }
    }
}
This code initializes a List<string> named ageCertifications with the given certifications and then prints each of them to the console.

Of course! Here's how you can create a List<string> from the roles you provided:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<string> roles = new List<string>
        {
            "Director", "Producer", "Screenwriter", "Actor", "Actress", 
            "Cinematographer", "Film Editor", "Production Designer", 
            "Costume Designer", "Music Composer"
        };

        // If you want to print each role to the console:
        foreach(var role in roles)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(role);
        }
    }
}
This code initializes a List<string> named roles with the given roles and then prints each of them to the console.

How to set a path for created files to project level withCSVHelper 
ChatGPT
To set the path for the created files to be at the project level when using CSVHelper and writing with StreamWriter, you can leverage the path utilities in .NET. Typically, when you run a project, the default directory is the bin/Debug or bin/Release folder inside the project directory.

To get to the project level, you can navigate up a couple of directories from the default directory.

Here's an example of how to achieve this:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.IO;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Navigate up to the project level from the default bin/Debug/net6.0 directory
        string projectDirectory = Directory.GetParent(Environment.CurrentDirectory).Parent.Parent.FullName;

        string titlesFilePath = Path.Combine(projectDirectory, "titles.csv");
        string creditsFilePath = Path.Combine(projectDirectory, "credits.csv");

        using var writerTitles = new StreamWriter(titlesFilePath);
        // ... rest of the CSVHelper code for titles

        using var writerCredits = new StreamWriter(creditsFilePath);
        // ... rest of the CSVHelper code for credits
    }
}
This code will place the titles.csv and credits.csv files at the project root directory. If you need to place them in a specific folder within the project directory, adjust the path accordingly.

Generate list of movies/series genres in a C# list
ChatGPT
Here's a list of popular movie/series genres that you might want to use. This is by no means exhaustive, and genres can be more granular or combined depending on your needs. This list serves as a general starting point:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<string> genres = new List<string>
        {
            "Action", "Adventure", "Animation", "Biography", "Comedy", 
            "Crime", "Documentary", "Drama", "Family", "Fantasy", 
            "Film-Noir", "History", "Horror", "Musical", "Mystery", 
            "Romance", "Sci-Fi", "Sport", "Thriller", "War", "Western"
        };

        // If you want to print each genre to the console:
        foreach(var genre in genres)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(genre);
        }
    }
}
You can always modify, add to, or remove from this list to better fit your specific use case.

Why are the genres not saved to the csv file? 
ChatGPT
If the genres are not being saved to the CSV file, there might be multiple reasons for it. Let's go through the possible issues:

Complex Type Serialization: By default, CSVHelper might not know how to serialize a List<string> property of a class. In simpler terms, when it sees List<string> Genres inside your Title class, it doesn't know how to turn that list into a single CSV cell.

One solution to this is to convert the list into a single string, perhaps using a delimiter like ; or |, before writing it to the CSV file.

For example:

csharp
Copy code
public class Title
{
    // ... other properties ...

    public string Genres
    {
        get => string.Join(";", _genres);
        set => _genres = value.Split(';').ToList();
    }

    private List<string> _genres;
}
Now, when CSVHelper sees the Genres property, it's just a string and it knows how to serialize it.

Mapping Configuration: If you've provided a specific mapping configuration for CSVHelper, ensure that the genres property is included in the configuration.

Writing the Records: Ensure you're actually instructing CSVHelper to write the records. Here's a snippet to ensure you're doing it correctly:

csharp
Copy code
using var writerTitles = new StreamWriter("titles.csv");
using var csvTitles = new CsvWriter(writerTitles, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
csvTitles.WriteRecords(titles);
Overlooking the CSV Output: Sometimes, the issue might be as simple as overlooking the data in the CSV file, especially if you're using an application like Excel to view it. Try opening the CSV file in a text editor (like Notepad) to ensure the data isn't there.

Errors or Exceptions: Ensure there are no runtime errors or exceptions which might be stopping the operation before it completes.

If you've checked all these points and still face issues, please provide the relevant code snippets, and I can provide more specific guidance!

Can you simplify this Bogus rule?
ChatGPT

Certainly! Please provide the Bogus rule you'd like to have simplified, and I'll do my best to assist you.




User
.RuleFor(o => o.Genres, f => string.Join(GENRES_SPLIT_CHARACTED, f.Random.ListItems(GENRES, f.Random.Int(1, 3))))
ChatGPT
Certainly! The given rule generates a random number of genres (between 1 and 3) and then joins them with a specified character GENRES_SPLIT_CHARACTED. Let's simplify it:

The rule can be made more readable by breaking it down into steps:

Generate the random genres.
Join them with the specified character.
Let's do this:

csharp
Copy code
.RuleFor(o => o.Genres, f => 
{
    var selectedGenres = f.Random.ListItems(GENRES, f.Random.Int(1, 3));
    return string.Join(GENRES_SPLIT_CHARACTED, selectedGenres);
})
This change doesn't make the code "shorter", but it makes it more readable by clearly delineating the steps involved.

How to rebase git history
ChatGPT
Rebasing in Git means to move the branch to a new base commit. The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. With rebasing, you can integrate changes from one branch into another branch without creating a merge commit.

Here's a step-by-step guide to perform a rebase:

Fetch Latest Changes (Optional):
If you're rebasing with respect to a remote branch, first ensure you have the latest changes.

bash
Copy code
git fetch origin
Start the Rebase:
If you want to rebase your current branch onto master, you would do:

bash
Copy code
git rebase master
If you're rebasing onto a remote branch, like origin/master, then:

bash
Copy code
git rebase origin/master
Resolve Conflicts (if any):
During the rebase, Git will pause if it encounters any conflicts. If this happens:

Edit the files to resolve the conflicts.
After resolving, add the resolved files:
bash
Copy code
git add <filename>
Continue the rebase:
bash
Copy code
git rebase --continue
If at any point you want to abort the rebase and get back to where you were:

bash
Copy code
git rebase --abort
Push the Changes:
If you have already pushed the branch to a remote before the rebase, you'll need to force push since the history has been rewritten. Be very careful with this, especially if others are working on the same branch.

bash
Copy code
git push origin <your-branch-name> --force-with-lease
The --force-with-lease option is a safer alternative to --force as it helps protect against overwriting work in the remote that you don't have locally.

Important Points:

Never rebase branches that are publicly shared and that others are working on. It can cause confusion as the history of the branch changes.
Rebasing can be complex, especially if there are a lot of changes to integrate. If you're new to rebasing, start with smaller, simpler cases to get the hang of it.
Remember, rebasing rewrites the commit history, so use it with care!
